1.  Install Java. 
2.  Insert the .in files into the "inputs" directory (multiple can be run simultaneously!)
3.  In the main directory, run:

java -jar HorizonWireless.jar all

4.  Wait, and watch solutions and their respective scores be printed to the console.
5.  If solutions slow down, use control-C to stop the execution and restart the program (this resorts edges and polls randomness.)
6.  All outputs will be visible "outputs" folder.
